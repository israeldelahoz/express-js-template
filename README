this is a template for an application built on express with the things I use the most:

socket.io
mongoose
passport(with a simple local authentication already implemented to go from there, and helpers functions for logged users
are already builded)
express-helpers and dynamic helpers are organized on the helpers directory

heroku

it has the necessary files to upload to heroku, you just need to change your app name on
package.json, add any library you need, and create/push your heroku app

instructions

once you have the application folder, and have installed nodejs, mongodb and npm(you can use nvm to handle node versions)
enter to the folder on a console and hit "npm install", that will install the necessary dependencies, the you can just
hit "node web.js", then you can go to http://localhost:4568 on your browser, there is a simple authentication system, so you
can register into the app.

you can change the name of the db and some basic options on /config/config.json 

so just, try this out, to start an express application and tell me what we should add or remove or improve,
send me a pull request if you would like to

I'm try to upload more code comments.
