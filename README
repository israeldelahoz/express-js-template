this is a template for an application builded on express with the things I use the most:

socket.io
mongoose
passport(with a simple local authentication already implemented to go from there, and helpers functions for logged users
are already builded)
express-helpers and dynamic helpers are organized on the helpers directory

so just, try this out, to start an express application and tell me what we should add or remove or improve,
send me a pull request if you would like to

I'm try to upload mor code comments
